## ðŸš¨ Critical Bug Fix

### Fixed UnboundLocalError Regression
This release fixes a critical regression introduced in v1.7.5 that prevented the integration from loading.

**Error Fixed:**
```
Error communicating with XCC controller: cannot access local variable 'entity_id' where it is not associated with a value
```

**Root Cause:**
In v1.7.5, the `entity_id` variable was used in logging before being defined, causing an UnboundLocalError that prevented the integration from starting.

**What's Fixed:**
- âœ… Integration now loads properly without UnboundLocalError
- âœ… Fixed variable definition order in coordinator
- âœ… Added clear comments to prevent similar regressions
- âœ… Added basic syntax test to catch future issues

**For Users:**
- **Immediate upgrade recommended** if you're on v1.7.5
- Restart Home Assistant after updating
- Integration should now load and function normally

**For Developers:**
- Added `test_basic_syntax.py` to catch basic coding errors
- Added clear comments explaining variable definition order
- This type of regression should be caught by tests in the future

## ðŸ”„ Upgrade Instructions
1. Update through HACS or manually to v1.7.6
2. Restart Home Assistant
3. Verify integration loads without errors

This is a critical hotfix for v1.7.5 users.
